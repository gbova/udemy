_TO DO: Add old notes from notebook_


# CSS - Advanced
### EM
* You can choose font-family based off of what the language has built in or do something like font-family:"Arial"
* EM values are dynamic ways of sizing things
* If you haven't set the font size anywhere, the default is 6px
* You can go to Google Fonts and link to free fonts
  * Each font provided will show you an example and tell you if it takes a long time to load


# Bootstrap
### Intro
* Framwork
  * Different from a library or package
  * Inversion of control: you give up control to the framework, which has non-modifiable rules/behavior
